# Angular 2 - Firebase - Observable - Weather

Here is an example showing use of an Observable to wrap Firebase for most
convenient use in Angular 2. As I write this November 2015, it is very early
days for Angular 2 with Firebase, there is not yet anything released by the
latter for use with Angular 2.

There are two observable supplied here. One handles an object in the most
straightforward way, the other automates the Firebase pseudo-array pattern.

See the source code for various details, and various open questions.

This is based on Angular 2, Alpha 46
